          <p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Cory, I am 21 years old and I have lived in Maryland all my life.
            I grew up with an older brother who has graduated now as well as a younger sister still in high school.
            In my free time I like to read, listen to music,
            game with my friends, and play sports like volleyball, basketball, and soccer.

            Another hobby of mine is traveling - I try to travel to new places I've never been to as often as I can. Last summer (2019) I ventured to Japan and visited cities like Kobe and Tokyo. During
            Labor Day weekend I participated in the North American Chinese Invitational Volleyball tournament
            in Toronto, Canada, where my team played against some of the best in the country in a culture-rooted
            tournament of 9-Man volleyball. Most recently, I studied abroad in Australia, exploring the country and taking classes at the University of New South Wales. My most memorable experience during that trip was skydiving in the Alps of New Zealand!

          <p>Creating or making something personal and unique to myself is important to me.
            I love learning and gathering new knowledge. I find inspiration from all over, and to be
            able to take those things and find ways to express them, whether in art, music, or any form really,
            is fulfilling to me.
            Having something to show for my work that encompasses my creativity is how I feel accomplished.
            This is something I hope to continue to achieve throughout my life as well as in my career.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a computer science major at the University of Maryland, College Park, I've been working hard to learn more about computers
            and the role that they play in our everyday lives. Interning at various companies like
            The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and Web Works Inc has not only
            introduced me to new concepts and ideas but inspired me to create on my own as well. This
            webpage is an example of this, and there will be even more projects in the future that I plan to share.
