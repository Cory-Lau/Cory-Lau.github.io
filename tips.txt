MULTIPLE STYLE TAGS IN HTML
You can use <div> or <span> tags. If the element is very small use span tag.
style=”property:value”
If you want to add more than one property , than make sure that you separate them by semicolon ( ;).And enclose them by ,one pair of double inverted commas(“”).
style=”property1 : value1 ; property2 : value2”

METADATA
  <!-- metadata is information about the html document -->

ID'S
  <!-- ID is for something unique. Use class otherwise. container is to allign in the
    middle and with appropriate margins -->

CSS
 . is for a class since container is a class that we used in index.html

 to style the div with id="branding"
 header #branding

another way to center/style this image is to put in a paragraph and text-align
<p style ="text-align:center">  <img src="./images/preview.png" style="width:128px; height:100px;"></p>

<img src="./images/preview.png" class="centered"> in CSS is img.centered {} not img .centered {} idk why
